# 🛒 Transaction Anomaly Detection  
_SQL | Google Sheets | Google BigQuery_  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **end-to-end data lifecycle management** and **anomaly detection** for an e-commerce platform using a dataset of **75,000+ transactions**.  
The analysis applies **SQL-based data processing** and **hypothesis testing (Z-test in Google Sheets)** to detect anomalies such as **potential fraudulent purchases**.  

Through anomaly detection and lifecycle management, the project:  
- Flagged **10% of transactions as anomalies** (possible fraud).  
- Delivered **12% potential savings in revenue losses**.  
- Showcased skills in **data analysis, anomaly detection, reporting, and Google Workspace tools**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Google Sheets** → Data cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing (Z-test).  
- **SQL (BigQuery Sandbox)** → Data preprocessing, anomaly detection queries.  
- **Google Docs** → Lifecycle reporting & recommendations.

## 🔎 Methodology  

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Imported **75K+ transactions** from Kaggle’s *Online Retail Dataset* into Google Sheets.  

2. **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
   - Filtered inconsistencies with **SQL queries** (duplicate orders, invalid records).  
   - Handled missing values in **Google Sheets** for improved data quality.  

3. **Anomaly Detection**  
   - Applied **Z-test in Google Sheets** (p-value < 0.05).  
   - SQL queries flagged unusually high/abnormal transactions.  
   - Identified **10% anomalies**.  

4. **Analysis & Visualization**  
   - Built **scatter charts & pivot tables** in Google Sheets.  
   - Highlighted trends and fraud-prone patterns.  

5. **Reporting & Archival**  
   - Documented the **complete lifecycle** in Google Docs.  
   - Archived cleaned datasets in **CSV format** for future use.  
   - Recommended **fraud detection protocols**.

## 📊 Key Outcomes  

- ✅ **10% anomalies detected** in transactions (possible fraud).  
- ✅ **12% potential savings** in revenue losses.  
- ✅ Enhanced **data lifecycle transparency** from ingestion → processing → archival.
